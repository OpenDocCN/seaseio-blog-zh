## 伦敦信息检索会议

我们很高兴地宣布第九届伦敦信息检索聚会，这是一次免费的晚间聚会，旨在为对探索和讨论该领域最新趋势感兴趣的信息检索爱好者和专业人士提供服务。
考虑到新冠肺炎的局势和不可能现场举办赛事，这次我们去**完全偏远的**。
晚上将安排 **2 场技术会谈**，每场会谈后都有一场问答。

## 程序

在我们的创始人 Alessandro Benedetti 发表简短的欢迎和最新消息演讲后，我们将进行第一场演讲。

// first talk

## Lucene-grep

我将展示我的宠物项目 Lucene-grep。Lucene-grep 是一个多平台的命令行全文搜索工具，它利用 Lucene 来完成工作并从中获得乐趣。

我在 Lucene-grep 背后的动机是将 Lucene 的魅力带到新的地方，同时使其安装和启动变得简单。这是一个有趣的任务，因为 Lucene 是一个 Java 库，被认为太旧了，太复杂了，很难破解。

在现场编码会议中，我将展示如何将 Lucene-grep 从一个简单的全文搜索工具，例如
" `
echo " Lucene is awesome " | lmgrep " Lucene "
" `
转变为 Elasticsearch Percolator 的替代工具。

## 使用 Quepid 收集多个评级

在 2019 年的 Haystack 上，Tito Sierra 和 Tara Diedrichsen 提出了改进搜索的人类评级测试计划。

在本次演讲中，我们将向 Quepid(一个支持 HRT 项目的开源工具)添加对多名评分者的多重判断的支持。我们将讨论一些分析方法来衡量评分者的一致性，并征求社区对后续步骤的反馈。

最后，我们将与观众一起做一些现场评价，以展示人类判断的一些缺陷。
